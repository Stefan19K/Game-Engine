Update 12.07.2023:
- modified ox rotation for camera (still not perfect)
- made the engine actually use the window related data from the configuration file (width, height, name)
- added a debug manager class that let's u choose what u want to show in the debug mode (featuring a simple terminal feature where u can write commands)
